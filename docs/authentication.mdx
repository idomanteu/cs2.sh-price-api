<Step>

</Steps>

## Required Headers

| Header | Value | Required |
|--------|-------|----------|
| `Authorization` | `Bearer YOUR_API_KEY` | All `/v1` endpoints |
| `Accept-Encoding` | `gzip` | All `/v1` endpoints |
| `Content-Type` | `application/json` | POST endpoints only |

```text title="Required Headers"

Accept-Encoding: gzip
```

Both `Authorization` and `Accept-Encoding` headers are required for all authenticated requests.

## Error Responses

### 401 Unauthorized

Returned when the API key is missing or invalid.

```json title="401 Unauthorized"
{
  "error": "unauthorized",
  "message": "missing or invalid api key",
  "request_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
}
```

### 403 Quota Exceeded

Returned when your monthly request quota has been exceeded.

```json title="403 Quota Exceeded"
{
  "error": "quota_exceeded",
  "message": "monthly request quota exceeded",
  "request_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "details": {
    "quota_limit": 10000,
    "quota_used": 10000,
    "resets_at": "2026-03-01T00:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

Upgrade your plan or wait until your quota resets on your billing date.

## Key Rotation

Rotate your API key from the [dashboard](https://cs2.sh/dashboard). Rotating generates a new key and immediately invalidates the old one.
