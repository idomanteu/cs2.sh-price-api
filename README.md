# The pricing API for Counter-Strike 2.

[cs2.sh](https://cs2.sh/) is an all-in-one pricing API that provides real-time and historical price data for Counter-Strike 2. Purpose-built to power developers, websites, and marketplaces.

Collecting, processing, and aggregating price data across all items & all major marketplaces is hard. We handle the headaches: tracking variant items, storing long-term historical data, and managing a stable market_hash_name schema. So you can focus on what matters.

This repository holds:

- [documentation](https://github.com/idomanteu/cs2.sh-price-api/tree/main/docs) (in markdown)
- [code examples](https://github.com/idomanteu/cs2.sh-price-api/tree/main/examples) for all API endpoints
